# TODO
## general
* highscores
    * online
* story
* find a solution to values depending on both the resolution and the difficulty, like enemy or ship speed. maybe resolution-based base value? or factor?
* ads?
* better controller support, probably with nes->gamepad mapping
* asteroid labyrinth

## playability
* long-term motivation
* increase game duration by lowering difficulty, generally better curve, replace level system with linear scaling?
* possibility of achieving victory

## enemies
* different types
* doing more than just flying at player; shooting would clash with the implemented health model
* formations

## polishing
* scaling values for resolutions i dont have
* background music
    * more tracks
    * fading in/out
* improve timings etc
* blinking etc on ships
* fix weapon spawn position

## store
* improve user discoverability of store
* better descriptions
* items
    * asteroid warner item
    * repair?
