# TODO
## general
* highscores
    * online
* story
* ads?

## playability
* long-term motivation
* increase game duration by lowering difficulty, generally better curve, replace level system with linear scaling?
* station life
    * shield has set amount of life; after that, the station is a one hit kill
    * shield quickly regenerates after each hit; but before it has x% of life back, the station is a one hit kill
* labyrinth mode: finish speed levels

## new gamemodes
* finishable mode -> endboss?

## enemies
* different types
* doing more than just flying at player; shooting would clash with the implemented health model
* formations

## polishing
* improve scaling values for resolutions i dont have
* background music
    * more tracks
* improve timings etc
* labyrinth asteroids rotation, random offsets, custom asteroids?
* speed level: tweening for less jarring increases
* fix framedrop for new labyrinth column
* effects
    * rocket propulsion
    * more blinky
